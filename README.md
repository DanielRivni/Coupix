🚀 CI/CD Pipeline
----------

To streamline the development and deployment process, Coupix utilizes a **CI/CD pipeline** powered by **Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes**.

### **Jenkins Configuration**

The pipeline is managed through a Jenkinsfile that automates the following stages:

1.  **Checkout Code** - Fetches the latest version from the GitHub repository.
    
2.  **Determine Version** - Generates an image tag based on Git branches and commits.
    
3.  **Build Docker Image** - Creates a containerized application using the Dockerfile.
    
4.  **Push to Docker Hub** - Uploads the built image to Docker Hub.
    
5.  **Render Kubernetes Deployment** - Uses Jinja2 templates to create deployment files.
    
6.  **Deploy to Kubernetes** - Applies the configuration to the Kubernetes cluster.
    

### **Docker Integration**

The application is containerized with Docker, allowing consistent behavior across environments. The Dockerfile includes:

*   **Base Image** - node:18-alpine for a lightweight runtime.
    
*   **Working Directory** - The app is housed in /app.
    
*   **Dependency Installation** - Uses bun install for package management.
    
*   **Build Process** - Compiles the application using bun run build.
    
*   **Port Exposure** - Exposes port 5000 for external access.
    
*   **Start Command** - Runs the app using bun run start.
    

### **Kubernetes Deployment**

The deployment is managed with Kubernetes, using the following configurations:

*   **Deployment YAML** - Defines pod configurations, replicas, and container settings.
    
*   **Service YAML** - Configures networking to expose the application to the web.
    

These configurations ensure high availability, scalability, and efficient management of the application in a production environment.
